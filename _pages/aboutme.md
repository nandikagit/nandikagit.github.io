My name is Nandika Nair and I am an ESG Data Engineer. 

## ðŸ’– My Path to Data 

I had an unconventional path to get to where I am today. I graduated from Cornell University in 2022 in Biomedical Engineering and International Science Policy. 

You must be thinking, *how did I end up in data?*

After three years in biomedical engineering, I pivoted to International Relations â€” an area Iâ€™ve long been passionate about. 

I joined an International Relations Lab where I was frequently asked to do data analysis/coding projects due to my STEM background. Thatâ€™s where I discovered my passion for working with data â€” turning complex information into insights through engineering, analysis, and visualization.

Today, I work as a data engineer, and Iâ€™m excited to keep building data solutions that help people understand systems, solve problems, and make better decisions

## âœ¨ My Current Role

I'm currently a data engineer at Bloomberg focused on onboarding, managing, and optimizing ETL pipelines for third-party ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) datasets. I also develop internal tools to improve **data quality**, **governance**, and **usability** across the organization.

In my day-to-day, I work across the companyâ€™s tech stack using:

* Python
* Jupyter Notebooks
* SQL
* Excel
* Superset
* Trino
* Semantic modeling
* LLM-based tools
